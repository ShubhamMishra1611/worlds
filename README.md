# Worlds

This is just a fun repository that contains hello world in as many languages as possible. Feel free to update if any.



## Code Structure

The repository contains a 'hello world' folder where all the files are located. The file naming convention follows the format `hello_world_<language name>.<language extension>`. For example, the file containing the 'Hello, World!' program in Python is named `hello_world_Python.py`
